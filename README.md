# Portfolio
This is a portfolio of my best computer science projects and assignments as a student at Westminster College. The 5 assignments I have chosen (in order of most to least recent) are:

K Means ++ implementation - CMPT 300 Machine Learning

Chat Shack (https://github.com/dalton-rutledge/ChatShack) - CMPT 352 Computer Networks

Math Games Website (https://github.com/dalton-rutledge/ColdCutsAndMayo) - CMPT 322 Software Engineering

Ray Tracing (lab) - CMPT 360 Computer Graphics

Waste Project: (https://github.com/dalton-rutledge/wasteproject) - CMPT 307 Database Systems


I have chosen these projects because they show my growth as a coder and as a student. They also represent my strengths as a student, because for many of these projects I had not previously worked with the tools involved in implementing them. 

Each project comes with a lovely description of its own - found in descritions.pdf - that details why I included it, what I think it shows about me, and how I think it represents my best work as a student. 

Also included in this portfolio is my senior capstone software project. For my project I created an Android application called Tweeter (https://github.com/dalton-rutledge/Tweeter) which uses an artificial neural network to classify song birds based on audio input. This project is the culmination of my work as a computer science student, and shows my ability to adapt to new technologies quickly. Building Tweeter involved audio processing, machine learning on time dependant data, and Android application development. Before starting I had almost zero experience in all three of those areas, but despite this, I would l consider the project a major success.

This portfolio also contains an up to date copy of my resume.
