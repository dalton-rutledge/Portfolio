# Portfolio
This is a portfolio of my best computer science projects and assignments as a student at Westminster College. The 5 assignments I have chosen (in order of most to least recent) are:

K Means ++ implementation
Chat Shack (https://github.com/dalton-rutledge/ChatShack)
Math Games Website (https://github.com/dalton-rutledge/ColdCutsAndMayo)
Ray Tracing (lab)
Waste Project: (https://github.com/dalton-rutledge/wasteproject)

I have chosen these projects because they show my growth as a coder and as a student. They also represent my strengths as a student, because for many of these projects I had not previously worked with the tools involved in implementing them. 

Each project comes with a lovely description of its own - found in descritions.pdf - that details why I included it, what I think it shows about me, and how I think it represents my best work as a student.
