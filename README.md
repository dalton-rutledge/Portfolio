# Portfolio
This is a portfolio of my best computer science projects as a student at Westminster College. Each folder contains a different project / assignment that I coded either alone or in a group. Many of the projects are also hosted on github in their own repositories, which I will list now: 

Math Games Website: https://github.com/dalton-rutledge/ColdCutsAndMayo
Waste Project: https://github.com/dalton-rutledge/wasteproject

I have chosen these projects because they show my growth as a coder and as a student. They also represent my strengths as a student, because for many of these projects I had not previously worked with the tools involved in implementing them. 

Each project comes with a lovely description of its own - found in descritions.pdf - that details why I included it, what I think it shows about me, and how I think it represents my best work as a student.
